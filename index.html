				<h2>Phenomenal Woman</h2>
				<h3> - Maya Angelou</h3>
				<p>
					Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.<br />
					I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's 					size<br />
					But when I start to tell them,<br />
					They think I'm telling lies.<br />
					I say,<br />
					It's in the reach of my arms<br />
					The span of my hips,<br />
					The stride of my step,<br />
					The curl of my lips.<br />
					I'm a woman<br />
					Phenomenally.<br />
					Phenomenal woman,<br />
					That's me.<br /></p>
